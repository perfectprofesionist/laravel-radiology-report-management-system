## Core Features and Capabilities

### 1. Role-Based Access Control and Security

Security and compliance are at the heart of our system. We implement a sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, ensuring that each user interacts with the system according to their professional responsibilities and regulatory requirements:

- **Dentist Role**: Dentists have comprehensive access to manage their patientsâ€™ radiology reports. They can initiate new cases, upload diagnostic images (such as DICOM, PDF, and standard image formats), track report statuses, and communicate directly with radiologists via a secure, integrated messaging system. Dentists can also review historical reports and manage patient records efficiently.

- **Radiologist Role**: Radiologists benefit from a specialized dashboard that allows them to review high-resolution diagnostic images, annotate findings, and provide detailed clinical analyses. They can approve, reject, or request modifications to reports, ensuring accuracy and completeness. The system supports advanced image viewers and annotation tools to facilitate precise diagnostics.

- **Administrator Role**: Administrators oversee the entire system, managing user accounts, configuring system settings, monitoring audit trails, and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations (such as HIPAA or GDPR). They also handle payment processing oversight, subscription management, and have access to comprehensive analytics and reporting tools.

Each role is meticulously defined to align with medical data protection standards, ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized personnel.

### 2. Advanced File Upload System

Handling large diagnostic files is a core requirement in radiology. Our platform supports uploads up to 1GB per file, accommodating high-resolution imaging and complex case documentation. For files larger than 100MB, we employ advanced chunked upload technology, which offers:

- **Reliability**: Uploads are resilient to network interruptions, with automatic resume functionality to prevent data loss.
- **Performance**: Real-time progress tracking keeps users informed during large file transfers.
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of medical imaging formats, including DICOM, PDF, JPEG, PNG, and more.
- **Security**: All uploads are encrypted in transit and at rest, ensuring patient data remains confidential.

This robust file management system ensures that practitioners can efficiently upload, access, and share critical diagnostic information without technical barriers.

### 3. Integrated Drag-and-Drop Interface

User experience is paramount. Our application features intuitive drag-and-drop functionality across all modules, enabling:

- **Effortless File Uploads**: Quickly add new patient reports or supplementary documents by dragging files directly into the interface.
- **Streamlined Case Reviews**: Attach supporting images or documents during case analysis with minimal effort.
- **Simplified File Management**: Organize, reorder, and manage files within patient records using a visual, user-friendly approach.

This interface reduces administrative overhead and accelerates clinical workflows, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on patient care.
